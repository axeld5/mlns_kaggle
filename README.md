# mlns_kaggle
Repository for the mlns kaggle challenge.

Each separate prediction was obtained using "use_X.py" file. In order to make the averaged prediction, one needs to run all 4 files and then run "main.py". 

All methods can be found within the folder methods. The folder utils contains all functions that can be used for handling reading information or submitting, and to put data into the format necessary to run the algorithms.

A synthesis of the explored and implemented methods can be found in the CodeSynthesis.ipynb notebook.
